        <p>"What is Code," is jam packed with information. A lot of it I had never thought about. It is really interestering how many things you can do with code, and how much code dictates the way a computer or program functions. I enjoyed his comparison of how computers work to looking like magic, even though there is not, just a lot of work to make it look like there is. I never really understood how an algorithim functioned, so it was nice to get a break down of how it works. I also found it interesting to see the statistics of how little women are involved in the field, it's great to see that there are companies out there devoted to teaching women how to code.There is so much information on the topic and so many technical terms it is easy to get lost in the information. For instance all of the programming languages there are. The scenerio that pops in and out of the article makes the information a little easier to understand. The interactive features of the website were also pleasing, except at times I found it very distracting while trying to read such dense information.
